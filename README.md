# cppman.vim

This is a vim plugin derived from cppman for opening cppreference documentation 
in a new vertical split inside vim. Press \<Leader\>c (\c for me) with the cursor 
over the identifier you want to look up.

## Installation

    mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/mattkretz/start
    cd ~/.vim/pack/mattkretz/start
    git clone https://github.com/mattkretz/vim-cppman
